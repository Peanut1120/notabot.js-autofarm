# notabot.js auto farm

A simple auto farm that calculates the cooldown and automatically farms crypto, minerals and crops.

## Setup
To get started, first install all the node dependencies
```
npm install
```

Next, open the app.js file and put your token inside of the token variable.

Thats it, next run
```
npm start
```

To start the farm and your ready to go, just leave it on.


## Configuration

In the `options` object you can customise what you want to farm.

To turn a module on / off change the farming entry to true / false, to change the item you want to farm change the entry crop to your choice (e.g. gold, iron, copper)

We recomend that you turn off crop auto farm as it looks really suspicious.
